# GraphQL.Extensions
 
GraphQL.Extensions provides extended functionality to [GraphQL .NET](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/) in a variety of ways:

* `GraphQL.Extensions.Pagination`
    * Provides standardized object and graph type to allow easy ordering and cursor-based pagination of query results
    * Automated injection of cursor into query results based on the supplied ordering clause
    * `IQueryable` and `IEnumerable` extension methods which accept a slicer and
        * Returns an ordered `IQueryable` or `IEnumerable` based on the supplied `orderBy` clause
        * If a `before` or `after` cursor is provided, a `Where` predicate is generated and applied to the `IQueryable` and `IEnumerable` being returned
    * Custom attributes which allow developer to restrict which object properties can be exposed in orderBy clause
* `GraphQL.Extensions.Filtering`
    * Generates a standard object and graph type to allow easy filtering of query results using any combination of AND and OR clauses
    * `IQueryable` and `IEnumerable` extension methods which accept a metafilter and returns an `IQueryable` or `IEnumerable` filtered based on that metafilter
* `GraphQL.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
    * Provides injectible store of types generated by this library.
